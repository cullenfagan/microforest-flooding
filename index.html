			<p class="intro"> <span class="location"> Bronx, New York — </span> In September, floods swept the city, reminding New Yorkers of the importance of coastal resiliency. According to experts, the Bronx is most at risk for hazardous flooding.

<p>
If more and more floods are expected to hit the Bronx, rapid solutions will be necessary to mitigate damage. 
</p>
<p>
Waste Management, the private waste transfer facility along the Harlem River, planted a microforest this October in an effort to help fortify the Bronx waterfront. 
</p>
<p>
Microforests grow at 4x the rate of normal forests, and increased forestation can help with coast resilience as tree roots lock up the soil and act as a natural barrier to rising river water and prevent inundation.  
</p>
<p> This is WM's 3rd microforest, and its first in New York City. To facilitate planting, they contracted the Wildlife Habitat Council, who assist private companies with microforest implementation nationwide.  
</p>
<p>
However, not all experts are as sold on micro forests as a magical solution. 
</p>
<p>
“People are really jumping on the bandwagon, and there isn't a lot of rigorous scientific information on how to do it,” said Richard Hallett, a research ecologist for the U.S. Forestry Service.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, according to Hallett, “even one tree” can help environments with climate resilience.
